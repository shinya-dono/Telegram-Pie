# what is this?

mere program that uses pyrogram to connect to your telegram account and count PV messages, then makes a pie chart and allows you to find your best friend :)
# Usage guid:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
``` python3 main.py ```

and then enter a name (not important but no space, symbol or etc...)

* then bot asks for your API HASH and API ID, you can find them in my.telegram.org
